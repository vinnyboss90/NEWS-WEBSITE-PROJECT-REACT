END OF PHASE 2 REACT PROJECT

PROJECT NAME: MODERN NEWS WEBSITE.

PROBLEM STATEMENT.


A modern News website allows news organizations to adapt to the digital age, reach a wider audience, and deliver news and information in innovative and engaging ways by use of APIs. This helps to enhance content quality, diversity, and timeliness while improving operational efficiency and user engagement. It allows news organizations to stay competitive in the digital landscape and deliver compelling news experiences to their audience.

SOLUTION.
The idea of the Modern News Website by use of News APIs is to enable news websites to scale their operations and adapt to changing requirements and user demands. Websites can easily add new features, integrate third-party services, and expand their content offerings by leveraging APIs without having to reinvent the wheel.

CHALLENGES.
As a newbie in the Tech industry in programming I expect minimal challenges in use of the new React Framework and the website functionality. Adding the dark and light themes also will be an add on if i don't get a challenge.
